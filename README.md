Pre-project: I am going to replicate the google homepage to familiarize myself with page layout.

Post-project: I am moving on, but I've had some trouble getting the bottom bar to cling to the bottom of the page without everything getting messed up. I suspect that, had I used flex, rather than grid, to structure the body, I would have been more likely to figure it out.
